# Simplified test for n=2
# Stack: ( v1 v2 e1 e2 2 -- result )

# Init 1
$b $a - / o !
:a:b:

# Put expected values on return stack
>  # e2 to R
>  # e1 to R

# Compare v1 with e1
<  # Get e1 from R
- # v1 - e1
$ok1 ?  # If diff != 0 and > 0, mismatch
# Diff was 0 or negative
# We need another check for negative
# Actually, let's use a trick: if v1 == e1, then v1-e1 == 0
# Check by: if (v1-e1) or (e1-v1) is non-zero, they differ
# But we already consumed the values...

# This is getting too complex. Let me try a different approach.
